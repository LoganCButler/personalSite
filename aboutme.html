									<h1>Logan C. Butler</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/loganAndSamm.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									Logan Butler, a native of Tampa, Florida, holds an undergraduate degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of Central Florida. An inspiring educator and technical industry expert, Butler has spent much of his career fostering deep conversations on interpersonal interaction and conflict resolution at various conferences and podcasts. His writing, a rich blend of stories and anecdotes, is strongly influenced by his hands-on experience in these fields.
								</p>

								<p>
									With an extensive professional background ranging from high school teaching and youth ministry to software development, Butler brings a unique perspective to his work. His diverse experiences and robust understanding of human behavior underpin the insights he shares in his writing.
								</p>

								<p>
									Butler's debut book represents his passion for teaching and his love of storytelling. Inspired by the works of renowned authors like Rob Bell, Bren√© Brown, and Rachel Held Evans, he crafts compelling narratives aimed at encouraging readers to better their lives, even when doing so may involve facing uncomfortable challenges.
								</p>

								<p>
									Beyond his professional life, Butler is an avid adventurer and family man. He and his wife have been committed foster parents for the last four years, a role they cherish deeply. He once kayaked 99 miles through the challenging waters of the Florida Everglades, a testament to his courage and determination, qualities that resonate through his writing.

								</p>

								<p>
									With a heart for encouraging personal growth and transformation, Butler hopes his readers will leave his work inspired and ready to confront their fears head-on. The ultimate aim of his work is to demonstrate how, by facing what makes us uncomfortable, we can lead more fulfilling lives.
								</p>

								<p>
									Butler appreciates kind, constructive feedback, embodying his belief in continuous learning and improvement, both as a writer and as an individual. His current work explores the concept of facing difficult situations as a necessary passage to blessings, an insightful tool employed by biblical authors. By identifying and facing our own fears, Butler argues, we can significantly enhance our lives.
